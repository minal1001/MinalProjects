      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
       Designing with code is an innovative approach that combines creativity and technology to create dynamic, interactive, and visually engaging experiences. This course focuses on understanding how coding tools and techniques—such as generative art, web development, and motion-based design—can be used as integral parts of the design process. Through experimentation and iterative exploration, students learn to harness programming languages and frameworks to bring ideas to life, enhancing user experience while pushing creative boundaries. The process emphasizes the importance of understanding how technology shapes design outcomes, assessing various methodologies, and integrating principles from creative coding and AI to develop functional and aesthetically compelling web applications. Ultimately, designing with code fosters a deeper appreciation of the relationship between art and technology, enabling designers to craft innovative digital solutions.
